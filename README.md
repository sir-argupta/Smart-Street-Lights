# Smart-Street-Lights
Developing solution to curb problem of wastage of electricity by street lights.
This include arduino as its main controller & open weather api's to get the
current weather condition for controlling the street light.
This project of AUTOMATED STREET LIGHTS is a cost effective, practical, ecofriendly and the safest way to save energy. It clearly tackles the two problems that world is facing today, saving of energy and also disposal of incandescent lamps, very efficiently. According to statistical data we can save more that 40 % of electrical energy that is now consumed by the highways. Initial cost and maintenance can be the drawbacks of this project.  With the advances in technology and good resource planning the cost of the project can be cut down and also with the use of good equipment the maintenance can also be reduced in terms of periodic checks. The LEDs have long life, emit cool light, donor have any toxic material and can be used for fast switching. For these reasons our project presents far more advantages which can over shadow the present limitations. Keeping in view the long term benefits and the initial cost would never be a problem as the investment return time is very less. Budget of connecting 80 streets lights. 
The project has scope in various other applications like for providing lighting in industries, campuses and parking lots of huge shopping malls. This can also be used for surveillance in corporate campuses and industries.
